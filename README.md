This is a temperature and realtive humidity predictor using a neural network.

This work was initiated as a MSc project at Imperial College London with the aim to assess how practical weather prediction with machine learning really is, both from a reseach and practical standpoint.

The thesis is available in this repo under "A Flexible and Lightweight Deep Learning Weather Prediction Model.pdf"
